    This function returns both a connectome dataframe that contains the weighted connections between bodyIds and 
    an undirected dataframe of synapses checked for bidirectionality. The synaptic weights are collapsed across ROIs. 
    The connectome dataframe can be used to create a graph of the connectome in NetworkX using from_pandas_edgelist. 
    The undirected dataframe can be used to run the clustering algorithms after saving it to a txt file and running it
    though A. Kunin's format_edgelist.py script.

    Usage Notes: 
        - Please makes sure to have your Neuprint client already created before running this function.
        - Remember to set the outputs to different well-named variable for future use.
